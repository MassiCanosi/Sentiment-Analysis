## Overview\
\
This README.txt provides an overview of a sentiment analysis project that utilizes randomly generated fake Twitter data. The project offers two alternative methods to solve the sentiment analysis problem, each with its own approach and results. This document will guide you through the project's structure, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.\
\
\
## Project Description\
\
The primary goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, even though the data is entirely synthetic. By using fake Twitter data, we can evaluate the performance of sentiment analysis methods without the biases and privacy concerns associated with real data.\
\
## Methods\
\
### Method 1: Straight-forward\
\
### Method 2: Using functions\
\
\
\
## Getting Started\
\
Follow these steps to use the code:\
\
1. Import files\
\
2. Manipulate data on csv\
\
3. Write a new csv\
\
\
The results of sentiment analysis using both Method 1 and Method 2 are presented in detail in 'resulting data.csv'. You can analyze the findings and compare the performance of the two methods.\
\
\
## Issues\
\
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.\
